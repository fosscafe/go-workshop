# Course Outline

GO 

Go finds application in developing network centric software, distributed computing environments and tools. Go supports automatic memory management, concurrency modelled around no-shared state and message passing. Powered by a feature rich standard library that supports I/O, text processing, cryptography, networking and many file formats and modern protocols.


LEARNING OBJECTIVE

learn Go lang programming by working through a set of modules that blend key language concepts and programming solutions to carefully crafted exercises.
